# exploratory_notebooks
Notebooks exploring and prototyping quick ideas. Sometimes an idea just gets stuck in my head, and I need to get it out into code to get satisfaction and be able to sleep at night. I expect most things in here will end up as dead ends, but that's good. The idea is to explore, fail fast, and employ a greedy algorithm for those things that work.
